# Vulnerability Assessment Report

## Project Overview

This project was completed as part of the **Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate** (Unit 5: Assets, Threats, and Vulnerabilities). The goal was to conduct a comprehensive vulnerability assessment on a mock business environment and provide actionable risk mitigation strategies based on the **NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1** framework.

## Objectives

* Identify security vulnerabilities within the organization's network and system architecture.
* Analyze potential threat sources and their likelihood of exploiting discovered weaknesses.
* Evaluate the severity of impact on business operations for each vulnerability.
* Prioritize remediation efforts using a standardized risk-scoring matrix.

## Frameworks & Standards

* **NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1:** Used as the primary guide for the risk assessment process (Identification, Analysis, and Prioritization).
* **Vulnerability Management Lifecycle:** Applied to ensure continuous monitoring and remediation planning.

## Key Components of the Assessment

### 1. Vulnerability Identification

I documented specific technical weaknesses, ranging from outdated software versions to misconfigured access controls. Each entry includes the discovery method and the specific asset affected.

### 2. Risk Analysis (NIST Alignment)

[Inference] Using the guidance in NIST SP 800-30, I categorized risks based on:

* **Threat Sources:** Identified both human (internal/external) and non-human threat actors.
* **Likelihood:** Rated (1-3) based on the probability of a threat event occurring.
* **Severity:** Rated (1-3) based on the potential impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA).

### 3. Remediation Strategy

The project concludes with a prioritized remediation plan. By calculating a total Risk Score, I provided a roadmap that allows stakeholders to allocate resources effectively, addressing "High" risk items immediately while scheduling "Low" risk items for future maintenance.
